## What is AWS CloudFront Integration?

An integration is a bundle of pre-canned assets which are brought together in a meaningful manner.

AWS CloudFront integration includes dashboards, visualizations, queries, and an index mapping.

### Dashboards

The Dashboard uses the index alias `logs-aws-cloudfront` for shortening the index name - be advised.
