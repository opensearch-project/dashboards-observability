This is the developer documentation for OpenSearch Integrations.

Some major documents to look at:
- [Setup](setup.md) explains the major steps of the integration setup process behind the scenes,
  which gives context for how integration content is assembled. To get more into developing
  integrations directly, there's the related [Config](config.md) document.
